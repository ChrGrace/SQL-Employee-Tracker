# SQL-Employee Tracker

## Description

The code is complete, everything works like an absolute charm - or it would if I hadn't forgotten my Mysql password.
While I get that reset, here is the completed project code.


## Installation

Right now, NA as there is no MySql. 

## Usage

## Challenges
1: Wrongly configuring the .gitignore file and uploading the node modules folder. That was a mess.
2: Not being able to use MySql atm.


## Credits

The man, the myth, the legend Taskinoz. Truly he has been instrumental in helping me learn coding, and the fact he takes time out of his busy day to sit down and go through these homework assignments is a godsend that I am truly grateful for.
